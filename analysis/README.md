# Empirical companion

This directory supports the paper's released-output illustration without adding
new model generations or treating the released benchmarks as external-validity
evidence. Its paper-facing core does three bounded things:

1. reanalyses all 32 model-by-benchmark cells released by Zhang, Koyejo, and
   Yang;
2. compares raw, null-referenced, and response-half tail estimators;
3. simulates cancellation, known latent effects, trial/tail sensitivity, and
   stable absolute failure.

A supplementary module tests how Pearson profile correlation behaves with only
ten domain means. It is retained because the paper discusses multidomain
profiles, but the current manuscript doesn't use its results as empirical
support.

The package does **not** validate projectibility to deployment outcomes, CHC
structure for machines, target-specific weights, construct validity, or any
mechanistic interpretation.

## Provenance and source locking

[`source_manifest.json`](source_manifest.json) declares the primary sources.
[`source_manifest.lock.json`](source_manifest.lock.json) resolves them to:

- Zhang et al., arXiv:2607.12963v2;
- `SALT-NLP/illusion-of-robustness` commit
  `411ceecd714068d161ab5ff307015a7e0eba8fd6`; and
- 64 public Hugging Face dataset commits covering the 32 baseline/context
  pairs, with the LFS SHA-256 and byte count of every Parquet file.

The full locked download is about 280 MiB. Downloads are placed in
`analysis/cache/`, verified before use, and excluded from version control. At
pinning time neither the GitHub repository nor the Hugging Face dataset
metadata exposed a license. The lock establishes provenance and integrity; it
isn't a grant of redistribution rights.

`pin_sources.py` uses the Hugging Face metadata API only to *refresh* the lock.
An exact reproduction should use the committed lock and should not refresh it.
The reanalysis downloads locked data files but never calls a model, grader, or
generation API.

## Environment and checks

From the project root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-analysis
.venv-analysis/bin/pip install -r analysis/requirements.txt
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m unittest discover -s analysis/tests -v
```

The tests cover metric signs and tail cardinality, exact cancellation,
untruncated negative corrections, deterministic response-half and absolute-tail
cases, constant-profile guards, source-lock completeness, pairing, and the
known-truth scenario definitions.

## Reproduce the artifacts

A fast smoke run uses one released cell and reduced Monte Carlo counts:

```bash
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.simulate_instability --profile smoke
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.simulate_pss --profile smoke
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.simulate_bootstrap_coverage --profile smoke
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.reanalyse_zhang --profile smoke
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.summarize_evidence
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.plot_hidden_distinctions
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.plot_stable_mean_states
```

The standard settings used for the committed companion outputs are:

```bash
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.simulate_instability --profile standard
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.simulate_pss --profile standard
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.simulate_bootstrap_coverage --profile standard
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.reanalyse_zhang --profile standard
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.summarize_evidence
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.plot_hidden_distinctions
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.plot_stable_mean_states
```

The equivalent shortcuts are `make -C analysis PYTHON=.venv-analysis/bin/python
smoke` and `make -C analysis PYTHON=.venv-analysis/bin/python standard`.

After one online run, add `--offline` to `reanalyse_zhang` to require that every
locked file already be present and checksum-valid. To run a single cell, add,
for example, `--cell mmlu_pro.gpt54`. `--skip-sensitivity` retains the main
32-cell analysis while omitting the more expensive trial-subsampling grid.

Refresh the source lock only as a deliberate provenance update:

```bash
.venv-analysis/bin/python -m analysis.pin_sources
```

## Estimands kept separate

For item \(i\), let \(\delta_i\) be perturbed minus baseline success
probability. The scripts report:

- signed change: \(N^{-1}\sum_i\delta_i\);
- INS: \(N^{-1}\sum_i|\delta_i|\);
- WTD at tail fraction \(q\): the negative mean of the smallest \(q\)-fraction
  of \(\delta_i\); and
- case-risk tail: the largest \(q\)-fraction of latent itemwise expected loss
  \(1-s_{i1}\). This is not the tail of realized binary errors.

The baseline-only pseudo-null expectation follows the authors' released procedure: two
pseudo-conditions are resampled from each item's baseline trials, and the mean
null INS/WTD is subtracted from the raw estimate. Subtraction is untruncated;
a negative null-referenced value is retained. This is a diagnostic relative to a null
centred on the baseline response distribution, not a general bias correction under
nonnull alternatives. Internal output columns retain the authors' ``adjusted`` label
for source compatibility.

The response-half procedure selects items on one random half of both conditions
and measures them on the disjoint halves, then swaps the halves and averages.
It removes reuse of the same noise for selection and measurement. It is
unbiased for the latent effect of the *noisy-selected set*, which can differ
from the oracle tail selected using latent effects. The simulations report both
targets rather than describing response-half WTD as a universal correction.

The case-risk tail is separate because a system can be stably poor:
condition-to-condition WTD can be zero while perturbed-condition loss remains
high. Both raw and cross-fitted versions are reported.

## Outputs

`outputs/zhang_reanalysis/` contains:

- `main_reanalysis.csv` and `.tex`: the 32 released cells, raw/pseudo-null/null-referenced
  INS and WTD, response-half WTD, split-half reliability, and case-risk tail;
  the directional components `f_plus` and `f_minus`, which sum to `ins_raw` and
  differ by `signed_delta`; and 95% item-bootstrap intervals (`*_boot_lo`,
  `*_boot_hi`, `*_boot_sd`) for signed change, INS, WTD, and the case-risk tail.
  Those intervals resample items with replacement inside a fixed design, so they
  carry item-sampling uncertainty only: domains, perturbation families, scorers,
  and model versions stay fixed, and response-sampling uncertainty is handled
  separately by the pseudo-null and split procedures;
- `download_audit.csv`: the dataset commit and verified file hash used;
- `published_comparison.pdf`: recomputed values against the rounded main table;
- `wtd_estimators.pdf`: raw, null-referenced, and held-out estimates kept
  visually distinct; and
- `trial_tail_sensitivity.csv` / `.pdf` when sensitivity isn't skipped.

At the top of `outputs/`, `evidence_summary.json` collects exact values suitable
for prose claims, while `section5_evidence_table.csv` / `.tex` and
`section5_evidence.pdf` provide a compact five-row table and four-panel figure.
`hidden_distinctions.pdf` pairs the directional components against each other
with the change tail against the absolute case-risk tail, both on the released
data. `stable_mean_states.pdf` is a constructed illustration, not data: four
item-change distributions with matched means and the worst-decile absolute loss
each implies. All figures share `figstyle.py`, which mirrors the parent
repository's house palette and is duplicated so this package reproduces alone.
These generated figures and tables are supplementary companion artifacts; the
current manuscript doesn't embed them. Its stable-state figure is drawn
directly in TikZ.

`outputs/instability/` contains the known-truth summaries, the explicit
cancellation construction, the stable-failure comparison, trial-count/tail-q
sensitivity, run metadata, and four vector PDF figures.

`outputs/bootstrap_coverage/` contains the known-truth calibration check for the
item bootstrap: per-replicate coverage indicators, a summary table, and run
metadata recording the population truths. The check separates three estimands
and reports coverage against each. The intervals are calibrated for the
population signed change, population INS, and the population raw WTD at the
given trial count. They do **not** cover the latent worst-tail effect, because
selection on response noise shifts the statistic far more than item resampling
varies it. Read a tail interval as item-sampling uncertainty around the raw
statistic, never as an interval for the latent tail.

The supplementary `outputs/profile_correlation/` module contains replicate- and
summary-level ten-domain results, a compact LaTeX table, sensitivity results,
run metadata, and three vector PDF figures. The conventional Fisher interval is
included only as a comparator.
The paired nested bootstrap resamples items within domains and trials within
items. Neither procedure turns the synthetic domains into evidence for CHC
transport or machine capability structure, and the current manuscript cites no
result from this module.

## Limits on manuscript claims

The released-output analysis can establish that the reported aggregate
cancellation and estimator differences are recoverable from the public trials.
The simulations can establish finite-sample behavior under their declared data
generating processes. They cannot establish that any metric predicts a new
deployment outcome, that the ten-domain profile is measurement-invariant, that
the affected items transfer across model families, or that behavioural
stability identifies a representation or control mechanism.
